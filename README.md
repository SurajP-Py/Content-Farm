# Content-Farm
## A Python project that automatically generates low-effort Instagram Reels
* Plays and Records 0-player Games
* Edits the video with a countdown timer and music
* Returns a ready-to-go mp4 file

## Customizing
<p><b>Adding your own game</b> to the generator is incredibly easy if you have some experience with Python and PyGame. Simply copy the "game_framework.py" file into another Python file under the "games" folder and build the 0-player game that you want. The random game selector now has a chance to choose your game.</p>
<p>You can <b>add your own music</b> to the videos by putting the mp3 in the "editing/music" folder, then adding "editing/music/[YOUR MP3 FILE NAME]" to the "audios" list in "edit.py"</p>
<p>Various other details can be changed by <b>adjusting "config.py"</b> in the "recording" folder</p>
